# EdgeVision-Exploring-Edge-Detection
"EdgeVision" is a Jupyter notebook that explores various edge detection techniques in image processing using Python and the OpenCV library.
Introduction
"EdgeVision" is a Jupyter notebook that explores various edge detection techniques in image processing using Python and the OpenCV library. This notebook serves as an educational guide to understanding and implementing Prewitt and Sobel edge detection methods.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
NumPy
(Include any additional libraries that the notebook uses)
Contents of the Notebook
1. Prewitt Edge Detection
Introduction to the Prewitt method for edge detection.
Implementation using custom kernels and convolution.
Displaying the results of Prewitt edge detection.
2. Sobel Edge Detection
Exploring the Sobel method, a popular edge detection technique.
Applying Sobel filters to detect horizontal and vertical edges.
Visual comparison of original and edge-detected images.
3. Combining Techniques
(If applicable) Methods to combine results from different edge detection techniques for enhanced results.
Analysis and comparison of different methods.
How to Run
Ensure Python and all required libraries are installed.
Run the notebook cell by cell to observe the edge detection processes.
Replace image paths with your own images to test different scenarios.
